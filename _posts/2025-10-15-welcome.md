Welcome to my academic portfolio website! I'm Jahir Uddin, a PhD student at the University of Nebraska Medical Center, working on AI-enabled safety systems for agriculture and occupational health.

## About This Site

This website serves as a central hub for my academic work, including:

- **Publications**: Research papers and conference proceedings
- **Presentations**: Talks and poster presentations
- **Blog**: Thoughts on research, technology, and safety systems
- **Resources**: Datasets, code, and other research materials

## My Research Focus

My research focuses on developing intelligent systems that enhance safety in agricultural and occupational settings. I leverage computer vision, machine learning, and sensor fusion to:

1. Monitor operator behavior and posture
2. Detect unsafe conditions in real-time
3. Provide actionable feedback to improve safety outcomes

## Recent Highlights

I'm excited to share my recent work on the **Agricultural Operator Monitoring System (AG-OMS V2)**, which uses advanced computer vision techniques to improve tractor operator safety.

Stay tuned for more updates on my research and publications!

## Get in Touch

I'm always interested in collaboration opportunities and discussions about AI, safety systems, and agricultural technology. Feel free to reach out via email or connect with me on LinkedIn and GitHub.
