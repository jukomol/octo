## Presentation Overview

This presentation showcases our work on AI-enabled operator monitoring systems for agricultural safety. Presented at UNMC Research Day 2025, this talk highlights:

- The critical need for enhanced safety systems in agriculture
- Technical architecture of the AG-OMS platform
- Real-world deployment challenges and solutions
- Future directions for AI in agricultural safety

## Key Points

### Problem Statement

Agricultural work is among the most dangerous occupations in the United States. Tractor-related incidents result in hundreds of fatalities annually, with many more non-fatal injuries.

### Our Solution

The Agricultural Operator Monitoring System (AG-OMS) uses:

- **Computer Vision**: Real-time operator tracking and pose estimation
- **Machine Learning**: Intelligent risk assessment and prediction
- **Edge Computing**: On-device processing for privacy and low latency

### Impact & Future Work

Our system demonstrates significant potential for reducing agricultural injuries. Future work includes:

- Integration with tractor control systems for automated intervention
- Expansion to additional agricultural scenarios and equipment types
- Large-scale field trials with commercial farming operations

## Audience Engagement

The presentation generated significant interest from:

- Agricultural safety researchers
- Industry partners in precision agriculture
- Medical professionals specializing in occupational health
