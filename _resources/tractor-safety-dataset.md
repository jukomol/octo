## Overview

The Tractor Safety Video Dataset is a comprehensive collection of synthetic and real-world video footage designed to support research in agricultural operator safety and monitoring systems.

## Dataset Details

- **Size**: 500+ hours of annotated video
- **Scenarios**: Various tractor operations including field work, road transport, and equipment mounting/dismounting
- **Annotations**: Operator pose keypoints, safety state labels, environmental context
- **Format**: MP4 video files with JSON annotation files

## Use Cases

This dataset is ideal for:

- Training and evaluating operator monitoring systems
- Developing pose estimation models for agricultural contexts
- Benchmarking safety detection algorithms
- Educational purposes in agricultural safety research
